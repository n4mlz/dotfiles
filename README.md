# n4mlz's Dotfiles üßä

This is my Dotfiles repository with install scripts for Arch Linux and Ubuntu!
This also provides a set of CLI tools, and can be deployed to SSH-accessible servers, WSL, or containers.
(Note: The installation scripts may not function correctly. Proceed at your own risk.)

## Installation ‚úÖ

Installation scripts automatically detect whether you are using Arch Linux, Ubuntu, WSL, or a Docker container, and perform the optimal installation for each respective environment.

(Warning: Understand that the installation scripts may be incomplete, and proceed at your own risk.)

- To create symbolic links only: `./scripts/deploy.sh`
- For a minimal installation and create symbolic links: `./scripts/install.sh`
- To selectively install individual tools: `./scripts/dev/[tool-to-install].sh`

## Features ü™∂

### Supports various environments üåø

This Dotfiles provides a set of CLI tools, and can be deployed to SSH-accessible servers, WSL, or containers.

### Smart Installation üì•

Installation scripts automatically detect whether you are using Arch Linux, Ubuntu, WSL, or a Docker container, and perform the optimal installation for each respective environment.

### Smart Screen Shot Operations üì±

My Dotfiles provide a simple and efficient key configuration to define and execute screen capture areas and functionalities.

The following key combinations with the `PrtSc` key will execute a screen capture:

- `Shift`: Toggles between capturing the active window or the full screen
- `Ctrl`: Toggles between saving the capture or not
- `Alt`: Toggles between capturing a user-specified area or not

Additionally, the screen capture will always be saved to the clipboard, regardless of the above flags.

For example:

- `PrtSc`: Saves the active window to the clipboard
- `Shift` + `PrtSc`: Saves the full screen to the clipboard
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `PrtSc`: Saves a user-selected rectangular area to both the clipboard and a file

When saving to a file, the directory ~/me/pics/screenshot is automatically generated, with the subdirectory named after the current running process (e.g. ~/me/pics/screenshot/firefox).

### (Unfinished) Try my Dotfiles with Docker üê≥

You can try a Docker container with my Dotfiles deployed from Packages.

(Note: Please be aware that my old version of Dotfiles is currently deployed, as the CI has recently been failing. I will fix this eventually.)
